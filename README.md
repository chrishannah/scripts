# Scripts

An assortment of person scripts I have that others may find useful

## tg

A customed version of [tmux-sessionizer][ts] from The Primeagen that lets you
quickly fuzzy find a directory and then attach/reattach to a tmux session with
it.

[ts]: https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/.dotfiles/blob/master/bin/.local/scripts/tmux-sessionizer

## ala

A fuzzy finder for alacritty themes, which is then applied on selection.

## fd

Another fuzzy finder thing. This time it searches the current directory for any
subdirectories with a max depth of 3. And then changes into the selected
directory.

## gt

Super simple git committing. Choose from a conventional commit type, add a
message, and then commits and pushes.
